## About Me 
Hi, my name is Jessica De La Cruz and I am a rising senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz double majoring in Psychology and Politics. I joined the serverless camp to aquire more coding knowledge and see how this new learning compliments my social science background. I currently work as a research intern for the Human Rights Lab for the Americas, a program spearheaded right at my own university. My investigative work lead me to familiarize myself with online programs like QGIS and other mapping software, which made me realize the potential tech has to increase the amount of good I am able to contribute to the world, and aid humanitarian crises, charity organizations, NGOs etc. I have seen how both the social science field and STEM field can be bettered by one another, and I hope my non-traditional coding background offers a new perspective on how these seemingly different fields can progress together.
